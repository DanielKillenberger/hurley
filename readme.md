# Hurley

Hurley is the **development environment toolset** for blockchain projects. It supports Hyperledger Fabric and is being ported to support other chain technologies.

It is an open source project under an Apache 2.0 license to help you create Convector projects easily.

## Prerequisites

* NPM
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)

## Usage

```bash
npm i -g @worldsibu/hurley
```

Hurley deploys Hyperledger Fabric 1.3.0 networks.

### Basic network management

```bash
# Start a new blockchain network with 2 organizations, 2 users per organization, and 1 channel, localted at ~/Home/hyperledger-fabric-network
hurl new

# Clean every blockchain network deployment component
hurl clean
```

## Details

### hurl new

Create a new blockchain network in your computer. The first time you execute it, Hurley will check for Hyperledger Fabric's binaries and Container Images.

```bash
# New project
hurl new
    [-o --organizations <amount-of-organizations>]
    [-u --users <users-per-organization>]
    [-c --channels <amount-of-channels>]
    [-p --path <path-to-install-the-network>]
    [-i --inside] # Whether or not the `hurl` command will runs inside the same Docker network where the blockchain was provisioned
```

### hurl clean

Clear your environment from all the components.

```bash
hurl clean
```

### hurl install

Hurley handles the lifecycle of your chaincodes through `install` and `upgrade` commands.

Be sure to run `hurl install` inside the folder with the source code you want to install.

```bash
hurl install <chaincode> <language> 
    [-p --path <path-to-install-the-network>]
    [-C --channel <channel>] # Defaults to ch1
    [-c --ctor <constructor>] # The constructor for the install function. Defaults to ' {"Args":["init",""]}'
    [-P --chaincode-path <path>] # Path to chaincode package. Default to ./<chaincode>
    [-i --inside] # Whether or not the `hurl` command will runs inside the same Docker network where the blockchain was provisioned
```

Language options:

* node
* golang

### hurl upgrade

Be sure to run `hurl upgrade` inside the folder with the source code you want to install.

```bash
hurl upgrade <chaincode> <language> <version>
    [-p --path <path-to-install-the-network>]
    [-C --channel <channel>] # Defaults to ch1
    [-c --ctor <constructor>] # The constructor for the install function. Defaults to '{"Args":["init",""]}'
    [-P --chaincode-path <path>] # Path to chaincode package. Default to ./<chaincode>
    [-i --inside] # Whether or not the `hurl` command will runs inside the same Docker network where the blockchain was provisioned
```

Language options:

* node
* golang
* If you are using <a href="https://github.com/worldsibu/convector" target="_blank">Convector Smart Contracts</a> be sure to package first the code through `npm run cc:package -- <your-chaincode> org1`

## Integrate to your development flow

Everything you need will be hosted in the Network Folder (default `$HOME/hyperledger-fabric-network`). You can use all the files in this folder to consume the network, whether in your machine or in a Docker container.

### Crypto materials for your users

All the certificates and Application files for your default users reside in `$HOME/hyperledger-fabric-network/.hfc-*`.

### Network profiles

Your network profiles will be provisioned at `$HOME/hyperledger-fabric-network/network-profiles`.

* The `*.network-profile.yaml` files: map your network if you run outside of the Docker network. For example, straight from your Machine.
* The `*.network-profile.inside-docker.yaml` files: map your network if you run an application inside a docker container in the same network as the blockchain `hurley_dev_net`.

## Roadmap üó∫

Have ideas? Post them in the [Issues section](https://github.com/worldsibu/hurley/issues).

Some ideas for future releases:

* Hyperledger version select.
* Invoke functions.
* Support Hyperledger Sawtooth.

## Important ‚öóÔ∏è

This project is currently under development and it's changing fast, but you can use it for your projects and if something doesn't work or would like new features provide feedback. We love community feedback!

Currently based on Fabric Samples from Hyperledger Fabric.
